Project: Classifying X-Ray Images using PyTorch

# Classifying-X-Ray-Images-using-PyTorch

Pneumonia is one of the leading respiratory illnesses worldwide, and its timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Manually reviewing chest X-rays is a critical step in this process, and AI can provide valuable support by helping to expedite the assessment. In your role as a consultant data scientist, you will test the ability of a deep learning model to distinguish pneumonia cases from normal images of lungs in chest X-rays.

By fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional neural network, specifically the ResNet-18 model, your task is to classify X-ray images into two categories: normal lungs and those affected by pneumonia. You can leverage its already trained weights and get an accurate classifier trained faster and with fewer resources.
